THE SQLITE3CC LIBRARY
=====================

The sqlite3cc library is a C++ wrapper around the excellent SQLite 3 library.
The SQLite Library has a C-style interface, and sqlite3cc is intended to make
the use of SQLite more comfortable in a C++ programming environment.

The goals of sqlite3cc are:
- to be elegantly designed and written, following principles of good C++
	design and those laid out by the boost project <http://www.boost.org/>
- to be fast, adding as small an execution overhead as possible
- to keep the API similar to the SQLite library

More information about the sqlite3cc library can be found at
<http://ed.am/dev/sqlite3cc>.

More information on the SQLite library can be found at <http://www.sqlite.org/>.

The sqlite3cc library was inspired by boost <http://www.boost.org/> and the
excellent sqlite3pp library by Wongoo Lee <http://code.google.com/p/sqlite3pp/>.
